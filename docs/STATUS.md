# Build status

**As of 2026-10-22 (merge of wave 2, PR #8).** Both pathways play end to end in the browser kiosk: attract,
onboarding, Pathway A (three episodes) or Pathway B (carousel of micro-games), report, survey and farewell.
Events reach the API and the scoring jobs run. Nothing is validated on real participants yet: every scientific
output is research-only, and player reports stay behind the release gate (fail closed).

Feature IDs refer to [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Binding rules are in
[`BUILD_DECISIONS.md`](BUILD_DECISIONS.md) and the layout is in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Legend: **Built** = code and tests in the repo, run in CI. **Partial** = built but with a named gap.
**Not started** = no implementation yet. "Built" never means validated; see [Validated vs research-only](#validated-vs-research-only).

## Validated vs research-only

**Verified by tests and CI (engineering correctness):**

- Event contracts: kiosk and server validate the same fixtures; every bot session event passes the strict validator, `seq` is gapless.
- Kiosk -> API: 963 of 963 events accepted in CI, event ids match the kiosk outbox, session closes as completed.
- Session budgets: both pathways complete within the 900 s cap in CI bot runs (Pathway A ceilings 865 s, Pathway B 890 s).
- Scoring formulas, dictionary integrity, scheduler constraints, content budgets, erasure and retention, RBAC.
- Parameter recovery on simulated players (`stats/simulator`), including the demo pipeline end to end.

**Research-only (not validated on people, never shown to players):**

- Every behavioural indicator, composite and trait estimate. No participant data has been collected.
- Reliability, validity, invariance, DIF and norming analyses: run only on synthetic data.
- Gates in `stats/measurement-model/gates.yaml` have never passed, so player reports stay disabled.

## Known gaps

- **Timing on real kiosk hardware is unverified.** No SKU is certified (ENG-02). The CI kiosk -> API -> scoring
  job builds with the test-only `ci-headless-test` profile (E2E bridge builds only; refused by the API outside
  ENV=dev/test; sessions graded `caution`, never reportable) and asserts real values for Don't-Tap `premature_taps` and `extra_taps`. On those GPU-less runners every module
  still ends on its hard cap in wall time (Don't-Tap at 108 s), so `response_consistency.rt_rvi`, which needs a
  completed Don't-Tap, has no value there and is not asserted. Under heavy CPU load modules overran their hard caps
  (Don't-Tap ran 173 s against a 108 s cap), so cap enforcement must be checked on kiosk hardware.
- **Native-speaker recordings pending.** No recorded voice manifest is bundled; the kiosk runs the silent voice.
  Weighing Post lines, the form-specific new-rule line and the optional Road Home hint lines are still missing from `content/i18n/lines.yaml`.
- **Translations are machine drafts pending native review.** hi-IN, mr-IN and ta-IN are LLM-assisted drafts
  (`draft_machine_needs_native_review`); back-translations must be redone independently.
- **Composure accuracy slope has no signal on Pathway A** (`no_reliable_signal`, `docs/science/indicator-review.md`).
- **Ingestion p95 is above the ING-02 target.** Target p95 < 300 ms per 500-event batch at 50 kiosks; measured
  tens of seconds at 50 kiosks and 1.5 to 4 s with one kiosk (`tools/loadtest/RESULTS.md`, open finding SF-01).
- **Measurement-model review needed:** recovery test tolerance .08 for `emotional_regulation.mirroring` (.06 elsewhere);
  segment ceilings were cut (onboarding 80 s, report and survey 75 s, contact opt-in 20 s) to fund measured module budgets.
- **Card Sort** switch position varies over 3 positions instead of 5; VAL-02's +5 post-switch trials do not fit the budget.
  Wait-or-Now `choice_consistency` and `effort_completion_rate` stay `not_scorable_v1` for the same reason.
- **Art and content:** the Steady Hands lit-lamp glow washes the frame
  (measurement owners to decide); wave 2 screenshots under `docs/screenshots/wave2` were not regenerated (wave 3 storyboard is current).
- **Only a read-only web demo is deployed.** <https://behavioural-games.vercel.app> (Vercel, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=1`)
  serves the web app: landing page, browser kiosk with uploads off, and the research and admin consoles running on
  synthetic fixtures from an in-app demo API. The API, worker and PostgreSQL are not hosted. No cloud backend, fleet, Ubuntu Core image
  rollout or OTA ring has run outside CI.

## How to run

Prerequisites, setup and everyday commands are in the [root README](../README.md). The short version:

```bash
pnpm install && uv sync --all-packages

# Kiosk game (no database needed)
pnpm --filter @shriii/kiosk dev                # http://localhost:5173 full session
#   ?module=<id> opens one module in the dev harness (dev and test-bridge builds), e.g. ?module=dont_tap

# Unit tests and checks (no database)
pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm -r --workspace-concurrency=1 test
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy && uv run pytest   # DB tests skip without PostgreSQL

# Bot playthrough of one full session against a test-bridge build
VITE_E2E_BRIDGE=true pnpm --filter @shriii/kiosk exec vite build --outDir dist-e2e
pnpm --filter @shriii/kiosk exec vite preview --outDir dist-e2e --port 4180 &
node frontend/apps/kiosk/e2e/full-session.mjs --url http://127.0.0.1:4180 --pathway A --cap-s 900

# API, worker and research web app (needs PostgreSQL 18; CI runs these)
uv run shriii-api migrate && uv run shriii-api seed --demo
uv run shriii-api serve                         # API on :8000
uv run shriii-api worker                        # job worker (scoring, snapshots, retention)
uv run shriii-api demo-pipeline --fast          # synthetic sessions -> scoring -> validation
pnpm --filter web dev                           # http://localhost:3000 (/research, /admin)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/`) runs everything above plus the database-backed pytest suite, Playwright smoke and
live research-page tests, the session E2E workflow (`session-e2e.yml`), Docker image builds, CodeQL, R and
Electron jobs. The nightly VAL-02 full study and the full OSV scan run on schedule or by hand.
